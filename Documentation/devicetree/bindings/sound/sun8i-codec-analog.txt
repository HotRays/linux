* Allwinner A23/A33 Analog Codec

This codec must be handled as a PRCM subnode.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be either "allwinner,sun8i-codec-analog"
- interrupts: must contain the codec interrupt
- clocks: a list of phandle + clock-specifer pairs, one for each entry
  in clock-names.
- clock-names: should contain followings:
   - "apb": the parent APB clock for this controller
   - "codec": the parent module clock

Example, in your prcm subnode:
codec_analog: codec_analog {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun8i-codec-analog";
	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 29 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	clocks = <&ccu CLK_BUS_CODEC>, <&ccu CLK_AC_DIG>;
	clock-names = "apb", "codec";
};
